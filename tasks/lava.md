# Task Title

Build a developer or user-facing tool that enriches the onchain visibility into Hyperliquid using Lava Network's high-performance RPC API endpoints. Examples include explorers, dashboards, extensions, bots, monitoring tools.

## 1. Problem Statement

Hyperliquid ecosystem need more visibility into onchain activity (transactions, token flows, user interactions, trading stats). An explorer or other oncahin activity monitoring tools would significantly contribute to network's visibility, transparency and user engagement.

## 2. Goal / What to Build

An explorer, dashboard, extension or other monitoring tool that displays onchain interaction data (e.g. recent transactions or fills, token flows, transaction lookup), updated in real-time.

## 3. Core Requirements (Acceptance Criteria)

List **exactly what must be working** for the task to be considered complete.

- [ ] Fetch data from the Lava RPC API for Hyperliquid
- [ ] Implement a simple usable UI for use interactions
- [ ] Display the information in the UI, update it in real-time

## 4. Deliverables

What teams need to submit.

- GitHub repo (public or private w/ access granted)
- README with setup instructions
- Short demo video (≤ 3 minutes)
